Create a Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud working environment in Cloud Manager so that you can create and manage volumes and snapshots.

Regardless of whether you have already created volumes from the Google Cloud Console, or if you just signed up for Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud and have no volumes yet, the first step is to create a working environment for the volumes based on your GCP subscription.

If cloud volumes already exist for this subscription, then the volumes will appear in the new working environment. If you haven't added any cloud volumes yet for the GCP subscription, then you do that after you create the new working environment.

TIP: If you have subscriptions and volumes in multiple Google Cloud projects, you need to perform this task for each project.

.Before you begin

You must have the following information available when adding a subscription for each project:

* Service account credentials (JSON private key you downloaded)

* Project name

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, add a new Working Environment, select the location *Google Cloud*, and click *Continue*.

. Select *Cloud Volumes Service* and click *Continue*.

. Provide information about your Cloud Volumes Service subscription:

.. Enter the Working Environment Name you want to use.
.. Copy/paste the JSON private key you downloaded in the previous steps.
.. Select the name of your Google Cloud project.
.. Click *Continue*.

If cloud volumes already exist for this subscription, then the volumes appear in the new working environment. You can add additional cloud volumes from Cloud Manager.

If no cloud volumes exist for this subscription, create them now.
